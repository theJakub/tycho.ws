Last weekend I attended the [Linux Piter](http://linuxpiter.com) conference for
the second year in a row. I have thoroughly enjoyed this conference both for
the caliber of speaker (Cristoph Hellwig and Lennart Poettering this year) but
more for the caliber of the audience. I receive interesting technical
questions, suggestions, and insights about my talks when I present there. I
would liken it to a conference like linux.conf.au: a less corporate/more
community focused audience which is highly technical.

Getting to Russia can be complicated for most, but speaking here is interesting
in addition to the technical aspects: the program committee puts on a "cultural
day" the day after the conference, showing visitors around Saint Petersburg,
which is a much nicer speaker gift than a box of chocolates or another USB
charger :)
