  <h2 class='title'>Unifying Logitech Devices on Linux</h2>
  <p class='byline'>
    <small>Posted by <span class='author'>tycho</span> on <span class='date'>2011-12-12</span></small>
  </p>
  <div class='content'><p>I was recently given a <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Illuminated-Keyboard-K800/dp/B003VAGXWK/'>Logitech K800 keyboard</a> and a <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Performance-Mouse-Mac/dp/B002HWRJBM'>Logitech Performance Mouse MX</a>, both of which are great devices. I picked them because wireless-ness is useful for ergonomic reasons, and they have rechargeable batteries, and you can attach them both to the same USB input, so you have fewer cables lying around.</p>
<p>Naturally, though, when I unboxed them I found out that you can only unify them to the same receiver with Windows-only software. There are a number of other features that are only usable with the Windows-only software, but I figured there would be a hardware sync process. Unfortunately, there's not a Logitech supported one.</p>
<p>There is, however, a <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/linux.kernel/msg/36c53d79832fc3f5'>community developed one</a>! There's a short C program with a bunch of magic numbers which send commands to the device and cause it to unify with a new device. Unfortunately, the program comes with no directions, so I thought I'd post about how to do it. First, put the program in <code>pairing_tool.c</code>, as suggested in the post. Then, compile it with:</p>
<pre><code>gcc -o pairing_tool pairing_tool.c</code></pre>
<p>To run it, we need to figure out where the Logitech unifying receiver is. The program wants the hidraw device corresponding to the unifying receiver. To find this out, you can look in <code>/sys/class/hidraw/hidraw*/device/uevent</code>. In my case, the device is <code>hidraw2</code>, and the output looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>smitten:~$ cat /sys/class/hidraw/hidraw2/device/uevent 
DRIVER=generic-usb
HID_ID=0003:0000046D:0000C52B
HID_NAME=Logitech USB Receiver
HID_PHYS=usb-0000:00:1a.0-1.4/input2
HID_UNIQ=
MODALIAS=hid:b0003v0000046Dp0000C52B</code></pre>
<p>So, we can now unify the devices with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>sudo ./pairing_tool /dev/hidraw2</code></pre>
<p>And then power on your device as the tool tells you to. I think there's some timeout on this, because the first time I did it I waited a few minutes and then powered on the device, and it didn't work. So, have your device ready and do it seconds after you run the pairing tool, and it should all work fine. HTH!</p></div>

  <h2 class='title'>Python "binding" for Ampache</h2>
  <p class='byline'>
    <small>Posted by <span class='author'>tycho</span> on <span class='date'>2011-12-19</span></small>
  </p>
  <div class='content'><p>Ahoy!</p>
<p>Just writing a quick post to pimp my new <a href='http://ampache.org/'>Ampache</a> "bindings", which are called <a href='https://github.com/tych0/ampyche'>ampyche</a>, naturally ;-). I slapped them together one afternoon mostly to get an understanding of the Ampache API, so that's why I used my native language. I have no specific plans for any python applications using them, but I'm interested in improving the stability of Android-based Ampache clients, as well as adding support for Ampache to Clementine, so I thought this would be a good place to start.</p>
<p>In any case, I hope someone finds them useful! Happy hacking!</p></div>

  <h2 class='title'>Mutt Sidebar Configuration</h2>
  <p class='byline'>
    <small>Posted by <span class='author'>tycho</span> on <span class='date'>2011-10-26</span></small>
  </p>
  <div class='content'><p>I am a <a href='http://www.mutt.org'>mutt</a> user (in fact, I'm a <a href='http://www.lunar-linux.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=44'>mutt-sidebar</a> user). That means several things, one of which is that I spend a nonzero amount of time configuring my e-mail client to behave as I want it to. I am also a <a href='http://www.vim.org'>vim</a> user, and in the spirit of loving vim, I set out on an adventure to make everything look and feel like vim. A natural thing to want to do is be able to navigate the sidebar (i.e. the folder list) with <code>j</code> and <code>k</code> keys as one does in vim. Reasonable attempts at this fail for various reasons, and I hope this post will explain why and also how to do what you want.</p>
<p>First, a natural thing to want to do is to bind sidebar navigation to <code>&lt;ctrl&gt;+j</code> and <code>&lt;ctrl&gt;+k</code>, since the <code>&lt;ctrl&gt;</code> binding indicates somehow that the navigation is "slightly different", and therefore is a good mnemonic for a "slightly different" kind of up and down movement. To do this, you could put something like:</p>
<pre><code>bind index,pager \ck sidebar-prev
bind index,pager \cj sidebar-next</code></pre>
<p>at the end of your <code>~/.muttrc</code>. However, this has an unexpected result: moving up and down in the menu works just fine, but now pressing <code>&lt;return&gt;</code> also moves you down in the sidebar, instead of opening the highlighted message (its default) or whatever else you had it set to.</p>
<p>The problem is that <code>&lt;ctrl&gt;+j</code> and <code>&lt;return&gt;</code> are actually the same character. That is, when you press <code>&lt;ctrl&gt;+j</code> the terminal interprets it and sends an ASCII 10 (the <code>LF</code> character), which is the same thing that <code>&lt;return&gt;</code> sends. In fact <code>&lt;ctrl&gt;+*</code> (where <code>*</code> is any character a-z) is bound to some control code (it's just that most of them are unused in modern applications, e.g. <code>&lt;ctrl&gt;+i</code> is an alias for tab). Unfortunately that means we can't bind <code>&lt;ctrl&gt;+j</code> and <code>&lt;return&gt;</code> to different things in mutt, since they're actually the same character.</p>
<p>So what's the workaround? Well, I decided that <code>&lt;alt&gt;</code> is just as reasonable as <code>&lt;ctrl&gt;</code>. Running <code>:exec what-key</code> told me that <code>\252</code> (i.e. octal 252) is <code>&lt;alt&gt;+j</code>, so I can add the following lines to <code>~/.muttrc</code>:</p>
<pre><code>bind index,pager \253 sidebar-prev
bind index,pager \252 sidebar-next</code></pre>
<p>but it didn't work! Mutt Well, it might work for some people, depending on their terminal configurations. According to the <a href='http://rute.2038bug.com/node5.html.gz#SECTION00560000000000000000'>Rute User's tutorial and Exposition</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The alt modifier (i.e. Alt-?) is in fact a short way of pressing and releasing Esc before entering the key combination; hence Esc then f is the same as Alt-f--UNIX is different from other operating systems in this use of Esc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what's the issue? Well, some terminals do this by default, and some don't. In xterm, the default is not to convert <code>&lt;alt&gt;</code> characters into the escape sequences mutt expects. However, by putting</p>
<pre><code>xterm*metaSendsEscape: true</code></pre>
<p>in your <code>~/.Xresources</code> and running <code>xrdb ~/.Xresources</code> and restarting xterm, it /will/ interpret <code>&lt;alt&gt;</code> keypresses correctly, and your <code>&lt;alt&gt;+j</code> keybindings will work.</p></div>

  <h2 class='title'>Google Voice ncurses interface</h2>
  <p class='byline'>
    <small>Posted by <span class='author'>tycho</span> on <span class='date'>2011-06-14</span></small>
  </p>
  <div class='content'><p>For a while I have been using a Google Voice number as my primary texting number since it doesn't cost any money and has the additional benefit that when I'm at a computer, I can type text messages on a regular keyboard instead of on my tiny phone keyboard. This is all well and good, except I don't particularly care for the web interface; not because it's bad, but simply because it requires you to have a web browser open.</p>
<p>To solve this, I wrote an ncurses based "chat" client, <a href='https://github.com/tych0/gvchat'>gvchat</a>. It provides and instant messaging interface for the most recent text message your GV account has received. When someone new texts you, it seamlessly switches to that new thread. At this point there is no way to initiate new texts, but I plan on growing the feature set in the coming months. However, for now it fits my needs so I thought I'd put it up for other people in the same boat.</p>
<p>Additionally, the client has a class 'Chat', which implements a crude ncurses based chat interface. As this improves, my hope is to add an XMPP backend for it as well. Any ncurses tips and tricks (or pointers to libraries which already have this functionality and are built on top of ncurses) are much appreciated!!</p></div>

  <h2 class='title'>A Tiling Window Manger</h2>
  <p class='byline'>
    <small>Posted by <span class='author'>tycho</span> on <span class='date'>2011-05-27</span></small>
  </p>
  <div class='content'><p>Ahoy! At the recommendation of one of my friends, I've recently begun using a tiling window manger. Although he recommended <a href='http://xmonad.org'>xmonad</a>, I decided to instead to go with a different project, <a href='http://qtile.org'>qtile</a>. I got myself a <a href='http://github.com/tych0'>github</a> account, since that is the primary avenue for qtile development. This means you can run the same WM code as I do :-). (I also posted the code for the framework that powers this blog, something I've been meaning to do for a while but have not gotten around to.)</p>
<p>I wrote a widget for displaying the currently playing track from your favorite player which implements <a href='http://xmms2.org/wiki/MPRIS'>MPRIS</a>, and I would be interested in any feedback other qtile users have, so feel free to send me or qtile-dev e-mail if you play with it! The widget can be found in both my fork of qtile and in the main fork. It depends on python-dbus, things like Ubuntu's update-manager do too, so it's probably installed for most users. To use it, you can simply put</p>
<pre><code>widget.Mpris(objname='org.mpris.awesome_mpris_player')</code></pre>
<p>in your qtile <code>config.py</code>. <code>objname</code> should be whatever the name of your MPRIS player is. You can figure out what this is by running <code>dbus-notify</code> and starting your player, and see what name it requests when it issues <code>RequestName</code>. For example, Clementine's is <code>org.mpris.clementine</code> (and is also the default).</p>
