    <h1>Spring break, 2010</h1>

		<p> This past week was my spring break, which I spent in Eagle county,
		Colorado skiing with my mom for five days! We stayed at the Beaver Creek
		Resort, although we did ski one day at Vail. Vail is a much more expensive
		area to stay/live in for a week, and I've always been curious why, so I
		kept my eye out for reasons why while I was there. Really, the major factor
		seemed to be the size of the resort. Vail is a mammoth 5,200 skiable
		acres, whereas Beaver Creek (and other resorts in Colorado) clock in at
		about 1800 skiable acres. The back bowls of Vail (where I spent most of my
		day) are simply huge; every where you look, you can ski. </p>

    <p> While we were out, we took some <a
    href="http://images.tycho.ws/sb10">pictures</a>. Most of them are simply of
    scenery around the resorts, but a few of them actually have us included :).
    Since I brought my fancy new phone on this trip, and it has a GPS, I was
    able to record my routes throughout the day. Below is a table with some
    interesting results (you should be able to open and navigate these files
    with <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a>). Beaver Creek has
    a run called Golden Eagle, which regularly hosts the alpine skiing men's
    world cup. I skied this run several (6-7) times on Friday, so that day may
    be of particular interest.</p>

    <p> Some other notes about the GPS data: first, I'm not sure what caused
    the max speed reading of 93 MPH. However, I'm virtually certain I was not
    going that fast (I think my max speed on skis is about 55 MPH). 93 MPH is
    the speed that mens world cup skiers would approach during competition, but
    only then on certain courses (for example, the one in Switzerland). Other
    than that, standard sanity checks on the data seem to pass. Also note that
    most of the tracks don't start and stop at the bottom of the mountain. This
    is simply because I was too excited to ski and forgot to turn on the GPS. I
    usually would remember when someone would whip out their inferior iPhone on
    the lift. This means that I probably skiied much (20% or so) further than
    the mileages show, which is pretty impressive if you ask me :-). </p>

		<p> All in all, it was a fantastic week! I would highly recommend both of
		these resorts. Beaver Creek is unique in that the very top of the mountain
		has most of the beginner terrain, which gives skiers who are not as
		advanced the chance to have some of the great views that other mountains
		won't let them see. Vail is Vail, it's huge, and not crowded at all, and
		probably not in need of my recommendation :). </p>
