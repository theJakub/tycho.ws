		<h1>Texting is a scam</h1>

		<p>This page is simply a nerdly rant about why texting is a scam. If you
		were expecting intelligent discussion, you might try <a
		href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4chan#.2Fb.2F">/b/</a> ;-). Also, I am
		not a cell phone expert. Likely, my numbers are off. However, I'm aware of
		this, so I've made very conservative estimates, and if the numbers are off,
		they're off in my favor, making texting <em>more</em> of a scam, not
		less. If you think I'm wrong, <a href="/misc#contact">e-mail me</a>.</p>

		<p>So, texting is a scam. What I'll attempt to do here is make an
		intelligent comparison between the bandwidth used by texting, and the
		bandwidth used by voice calls. It's a bit difficult to do a direct
		comparison, since voice calls are analog on (traditional) land lines, and
		digital on cell phones. For this excercise, we'll assume that all voice
		calls consume an equivalent amount of digital bandwith, namely, 8,400
		bits/second. I'm using this as an overestimate for what Wikipedia says is
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rate#Other_audio">telephone
		quality</a>.</p>
		
		<p>Also, I'll assume the data rate of <a
		href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cdma2000">CDMA2000</a>, which is an old
		standard availible from cell phone giants such as Verizon. 1xRTT has a peak
		throughput of 144 kbits/second, which we'll round down to 100 kbits/second,
		since I'm such a great guy. This doesn't matter for the initial analysis,
		but it makes the numbers _way_ more fun in future analyses (:</p>

		<p>Now, we examine what it costs cell phone companies to transmit this kind
		of data. On most (all?) networks, in-network mobile to mobile calls are
		free. So, if I call anyone, any time, on my network, it's free. Suppose
		I've made a 5 minute call to my best friend who's on my same network.
		Valuing voice calls at 8,400 bits/second, I've consumed 5 x 60 x 8,400 =
		2,520,000 bits = 315,000 bytes of "bandwidth".</p> 

		<p>A text (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS">SMS</a>) message can
		be transmitted as 160 7-bit characters, or, more likely, 140 octets. Again,
		though, I'll be generous and say that a text message costs 184 bytes to
		transmit.</p>

		<p>Given this, during our hypothetical five minute call, we could have
		transmitted 315,000 / 184 = ~1700 text messages (I rounded down, again). At
		$0.10 a message, that's $170! If I buy an extra $20/mo unlimited texting
		plan, then it only costs $20 for those messages. However, this is for the
		<strong>exact same bandwidth</strong> that you would use if you were
		talking with regular voice chat, and that was free.</p>

		<p>Here's where it really gets fun. Cell phones are bad at voice
		communications (yes, you read that right). In fact, transmitting digital
		data is much cheaper in terms of battery life, and in terms of load on the
		carriers. CDMA2000 networks have a _huge_ throughput -- 102,400
		bits/second, compared to voice's 8,400. And, CDMA2000 is an old standard.
		If you allow users to use EV-DV type communications (a modern version of
		CDMA2000), you can get theoretical data rates of 3,250,000 bits (with 3G/4G
		speeds, this grows even more). Since text messages get to use the data
		rates, rather than the voice rates, our 5 minute voice call at EV-DV rates
		is equivalent to 5 * 60 * 3,250,000 bits * (1 byte / 8 bits) * (1 text
		message / 184 bytes) = 662,100 text messages!</p>

		<p>Now, I don't claim to be an expert on cell networks, so maybe it's not
		this bad. But, the way it looks now, texts are at least <strong>5 orders of
		magnitude</strong> more expensive than they ought to be.</p>
