  <div class='content'><p>There has been a lot of interest on the various mailing lists as well as internally at Canonical about the state of migration in LXD, so I thought I'd write a bit about the current state of affairs.</p>
<p>Migration in LXD today passes the "Doom demo" test, i.e. it works well enough to reproduce the <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9T2gcnQg2k&t=1189'>LXD announcement demo</a> under certain conditions, which I'll cover below. There is still a lot of ongoing work to make <a href='http://criu.org'>CRIU</a> (the underlying migration technology) work with all these configurations, so support will eventually arrive for everything. For now, though, you'll need to use the configuration I describe below.</p>
<p>First, I should note that things currently won't work on a systemd host. Since systemd re-mounts the rootfs as <code>MS_SHARED</code>, lots of things automatically become shared mounts, which confuses CRIU. There are <a href='http://lists.openvz.org/pipermail/criu/2015-April/019585.html'>several</a> <a href='http://lists.openvz.org/pipermail/criu/2015-March/019299.html'>mailing list</a> <a href='http://lists.openvz.org/pipermail/criu/2015-April/019652.html'>threads</a> about ongoing work with respect to shared mounts in CRIU and I expect something to be merged that will resolve the situation shortly, but for now your host machine needs to be a non-systemd host (i.e. trusty or utopic will work just fine, but not vivid).</p>
<p>You'll need to install the daily versions of liblxc and lxd from their respective PPAs on each host:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-lxc/daily
sudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-lxc/lxd-git-master
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install lxd</code></pre>
<p>Also, you'll need to uninstall <code>lxcfs</code> on both hosts:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt-get remove lxcfs</code></pre>
<p><code>liblxc</code> currently doesn't support migrating the mount configuration that lxcfs uses, although there is <a href='http://lists.openvz.org/pipermail/criu/2015-March/019530.html'>some work</a> on that as well. The overmounting issue has been fixed in lxcfs, so I expect to land some patches in liblxc soon that will make lxcfs work.</p>
<p>Next, you'll want to set a password for your new lxd instance:</p>
<pre><code>lxc config set password foo</code></pre>
<p>You need some images in <code>lxd</code>, which can be acquired easily enough by lxd-images (of course, this only needs to be done on the source host of the migration):</p>
<pre><code>lxd-images import lxc ubuntu trusty amd64 --alias ubuntu</code></pre>
<p>You'll also need to set a few configuration items in lxd. First, the container needs to be privileged, although there is <a href='http://lists.openvz.org/pipermail/criu/2015-February/018934.html'>yet more</a> ongoing work to remove this restriction. There are also a few things that CRIU does not support, so we need to set our container config to respect those as well. You can do all of this using lxd's profiles mechanism, that is:</p>
<pre><code>lxc config profile create migratable
lxc config profile edit migratable</code></pre>
<p>And paste the following content in instead of what's there:</p>
<pre><code>name: migratable
config:
  raw.lxc: |
    lxc.console = none
    lxc.cgroup.devices.deny = c 5:1 rwm
    lxc.start.auto =
    lxc.start.auto = proc:mixed sys:mixed
  security.privileged: "true"
devices:
  eth0:
    nictype: bridged
    parent: lxcbr0
    type: nic</code></pre>
<p>Finally, launch your contianer:</p>
<pre><code>lxc launch ubuntu migratee -p migratable</code></pre>
<p>Finally, add both of your LXDs as non unix-socket remotes (<a href='https://github.com/lxc/lxd/blob/master/lxc/copy.go#L79'>required</a> for now, but not forever):</p>
<pre><code>lxc remote add lxd thishost:8443   # don't use localhost here
lxc remote add lxd2 otherhost:8443 # use a publicly addressable name</code></pre>
<p>Profiles used by a particular container need to be present on both the source of the migration and the sink, so we should copy the profile to the sink as well:</p>
<pre><code>lxc config profile copy migratable lxd2:</code></pre>
<p>And now, you're ready for the magic!</p>
<pre><code>lxc start migratee
lxc move lxd:migratee lxd2:migratee</code></pre>
<p>With luck, you'll have migrated the container to <code>lxd2</code>. Of course, things don't always go right the first time. The full log file for the migration attempts should be available in <code>/var/log/lxd/migratee/migration_{dump|restore}_&lt;timestamp&gt;.log</code>, on the respective host where the dump or restore took place. If you aren't successful in migrating things (or parsing the dump/restore log), feel free to mail <a href='https://lists.linuxcontainers.org/listinfo/lxc-users'>lxc-users</a>, and I can help you debug what went wrong.</p>
<p>Happy hacking!</p></div>
